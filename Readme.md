# Algorithmic Fairness of Statistical Decision Systems

This is a talk that I presented on August 14, 2021 during the final year of my M.Stat. at Indian Statistical Institute, for the PCM Memorial Gold Medal Presentation. In this talk, I discussed the fairness aspect of the statistical decision systems, various ethical issues associated with the automated statistical systems which are designed to take crucial decisions, and how to quantify these seemingly qualitative aspect of those systems.
